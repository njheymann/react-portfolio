            <p>
              I'm a 28-year-old residing on the picturesque Northern Beaches of
              Sydney. With nine years of experience as a qualified boatbuilder,
              my passion for craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail is
              evident. However, my true enthusiasm lies in the realm of
              technology.

              Hobbies: <br />I have always enjoyed building small projects with
              timber, turning pieces of wood into functional and beautiful
              creations. Whether it's crafting a custom piece of furniture or
              carving intricate designs, woodworking has been a cherished hobby
              of mine.

              Beyond my workshop, you'll often find me chasing waves along the
              stunning coastline of Sydney. Surfing has been a lifelong passion
              that keeps me connected to the ocean's rhythm and the thrill of
              riding the perfect wave.
            </p>

              I've converted my van into a cozy mobile haven for adventures.
              Camping in my van allows me to explore new places, connect with
              nature, and experience the freedom of the open road. When I'm not
              working on projects or riding waves, I enjoy long walks with my
              dog. These moments of tranquility provide the perfect balance to
              my active lifestyle.
            </p>

              My journey in the world of technology isn't just a career shift;
              it's an opportunity to combine my love for craftsmanship and
              problem-solving with my desire for continuous learning. I'm
              excited about the prospect of building a new chapter in my life,
              one that merges my passion for innovation with my affinity for the
              great outdoors
